This takes a word list, and generates combinations of 3 words. With a surprisingly small word list, you can get a large number of unique identifiers. Like What3Words, but for anything and  everything.

(number of unique words)^3 => (100)^3 = 1 million

22^3 = 10,648

for 10,648 unique nft, for example, names, you need 22 words. Which are also within the realm of memorization for a human - especially if they can be arranged in a meaningful way.
